* A metrics calculation and storage system

The firm dashboard is a system that I implemented for Clio. It is an on-demand
system that gathers data, transforms it, and reduces it into a set of metrics
for rendering in a graph. I built it with modularity in mind so that new
infrastructure may be added and used as a new data source or data store in the
future.
