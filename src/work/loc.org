* A system to find and sort locations distance in Javascript, C#, and PostgreSQL/PostGIS

The store locator is unique in that it does not rely entirely on one service for
it's operation. Whenever an address is added into the database, the
[[./ae.html][Automation Engine]] caches address data with geolocation
coordinates (currently Google, but theoretically any service could substitute).
When the store locator is queried, PostGIS does a great circle calculation to
the nearest locations and returns with a top list including metadata. On the
front end it overlays our data on top of a google map. However, since the data
is ours, it would be trivial to switch to another service for visualization such
as Apple Maps, or OpenStreetMap should usage terms change in the future.
